# -OverTheWire-Bandit-Level-3-Level-4
In this lab I located the password for Bandit Level 4, which is hidden inside a dot-file in the inhere directory. I used ssh to connect on the non-standard port, inspected the directory (including hidden files), and read the hidden file to retrieve the password — then saved it to my notes.
